#### GAE-Crawler

A simple crawler running on GAE, using cronjob and configurable online.
One can write his own procedure to process certain jobs with certain parameters.

Basically, it can only fetch the same URL over and over after some time. 
Good for monitoring something you are interested in, such as on-sale stuffs on [smzdm](http://smzdm.com), or second-hand stuffs on [xianyu](http://2.taobao.com).

Currently not support recursive crawling, i.e. privide a seed url, let tool to crawl recursively.

Still WIP.
